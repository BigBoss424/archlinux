### Visual Codium 
Date: 3/30/2023
I installed Visual Codium in order to compare the differences between VS Code and Sublime Text. In order to utilize a editor that will not take up so much RAM and is less resource intensive. 

I am hoping that Visual Codium, doesn't have the additional bloatware that comes with Visual Studio Code.
