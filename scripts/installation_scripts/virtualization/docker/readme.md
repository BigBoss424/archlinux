# Docker Install Scripts

## Purpose
The purpose of these install scripts is to properly install Docker on 
Arch Linux. 

I will be creating two install scripts:
    1. Install Script 1: Based of the Binaries found in Pacman
    2. Install Script 2: Based on the Binary required to install Docker-Desktop
