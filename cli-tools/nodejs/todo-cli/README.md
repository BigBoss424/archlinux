# Todo List CLI Tool in Node.js

## Node.js and the CLI
	I didn't realize that I could be creating tools for the command line using Node.js. Though I believe I will need to review some more on it because I was able to get it to work, but barely. The structure of the program itself needs working. 
## Source Code
	My Source code is derived from https://github.com/shahednasser/todos-cli from a website LogRocket. 

	Unfortunately this example didn't work.
